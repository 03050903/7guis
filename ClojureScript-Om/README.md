7GUIs in ClojureScript Om
=========================

This is an implementation of 7GUIs in ClojureScript with Om, a ClojureScript
interface to Facebook's React library.

To run this example, first install Leiningen, then in the ClojureScript-Om directory run:

```lein figwheel```

Now go to http://localhost:3449/ to run the example.

Currently, only the counter is implemented.
