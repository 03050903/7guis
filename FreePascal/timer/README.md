The relevant file to read is unit1.pas . The rest of the files are generated by Lazarus/CodeTyphon visual editor. 

To test it in Lazarus/CodeTyphon you have to open timer.lpi
 
The file "timer" (without extension) is a linux64/gtk2 executable.If i have time will make one with fpgui or mse widgetset (that only requires X11).
